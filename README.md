# Virtual-Police-Station
This project is made to automate the Police Station. This program basically takes all the required details and generates a document file for the registration of FIR.
After some improvement, I think this app can be used in Computers of Police Station of India(or any other Country). This project partially support Hindi Language right now and can be developed for more local Languages. Your small contribution is gonna be very helpful, I would love to merge your pull requests.
